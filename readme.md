# Game Programming End of Year Lab Test 2016

## Instructions
- Start with a blank Processing sketch
- You can use any examples from your git repo, my git repo and use the Processing reference
- No use of Google or Facebook and no conferring
- When you are finished, submit the link to your git repo.
- If you are not confident you can use git, then zip up your code and submit it through websources
- Remember to save and commit often!
- You have 4 hours

Today you wil be making this Processing sketch (video link):

Whats happening:

The plane goes from left to right. When it reaches the right side of the screen, it reappears on the left.
There are 5 random clouds that move at different speeds from right to left. When the clouds disappear from the left, they will reappear on the right
Pressing space causes the plane to drop a box. The box will land somewhere randomly on the ground. Look carefully at how the box moves.
When the box lands, the little purple person will go and fetch it. When the purple person gets the box, it goes back to it's start point.

Here is the marking scheme:

| Description | Marks |
|-------------|-------|
| Implementing the plane | 20 |
| Implementing the clouds | 20 |
| Implementing bomb dropping | 20 |
| Implementing the person | 25 |
| Use of git | 15 |

Rubric

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 90+   | Everything works. You have used classes, inheritance, game objects, polymorphism  and gravity in your solution |
| 80 - 89 | Mostly all working, with some minor issues. Also you might have used classes but no polymorphism |
| 70 -79 | The plane, clouds and boxes fully working. The person is incomplete. You have used classes. |
| 60-69 | The plane and clouds are fully working and the person is drawn. You have used classes. Alternatively, the plane clouds are boxes are working but no classes.
| 50-59 | No classes, just processing drawing code, methods and if statements. Plane and clouds are working
| 40-49 | Just processing drawing code, methods and if statements. No classes. Either the plane or clouds are working |
| < 40 | Just processing drawing code, methods and if statements, nothing works. No use of git |
